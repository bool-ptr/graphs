# general rules:

 1. DFS:
    a. Whichever vertex one's exploring, they have to suspend it once they move on to the next vertex.
    b. We use stack to do a DFS on a graph. 
    
2. BFS:
     a. We use a queue to do a BFS on a graph.
     b. Completely explore the vertex, whatever one finds after exploring, store in a queue, selsct the next vertex to explore from the queue/
